# Verify Bank Card

The _Verify Bank Card_ application is designed to verify the entered number in several respects:

- checks the entered data type,
- checks the length of the number,
- checks the initial number index.

Based on the above information, the algorithm verifies whether the card number is correct and provides the user with information about who the card issuer is.

The application also has the function of copying the result and resetting the form.
